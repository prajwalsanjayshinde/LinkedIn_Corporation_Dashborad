# LinkedIn Business Intelligence: Student Career Guidance

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to enhance LinkedIn's engagement with student users by providing actionable, data-driven career insights through business intelligence (BI) dashboards and predictive analytics. Our solution supports students in navigating job markets, identifying in-demand skills, and aligning educational goals with industry trends.

## 🚀 Objective

Many students struggle to start their career journey due to lack of guidance on what roles to pursue, what skills to develop, and where to look for opportunities. Our project uses internal LinkedIn data, machine learning models, and visual analytics to:

- Recommend career paths based on job market trends
- Predict salaries for student-level roles
- Highlight top hiring companies and in-demand skills by region

## 💡 Proposed BI Solution

We developed three core BI prototypes:

### 1. **Student Job Market Explorer**
- Visualizes job postings by industry, skill, and location
- Includes interactive filters for experience level, work type, and region
- Identifies high-demand skills and job-rich areas

### 2. **Employer & Skill Demand Dashboard**
- Highlights top hiring companies for students
- Maps skill demand across U.S. states
- Tracks engagement levels by role and industry

### 3. **Predictive Salary Model**
- Trained using LinkedIn job post data with features from skills and benefits
- Uses Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated with R² and RMSE metrics to ensure accuracy
